Given the small footprint of the stand, it is easy to put it on some sort of shelf. In this picture, I put it on a wine box as a proof of concept :-). It might be more of an issue if you are out and about a lot, where carrying a shelf is not exactly practical. [@justinhudgins](https://micro.blog/justinhudgins)
