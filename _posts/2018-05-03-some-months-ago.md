Some months ago I spent a pretty penny on an iPad stand from [Yohann](https://yohann.com/eu/en/). I thought at the time the purchase was a bit extravagant, but the stand has turned out to be a wonderful investment. I love it and use it all the time. At the desk, sitting in a chair, or in bed. Top marks!
