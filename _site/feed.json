I am in love with their rucksacks, and since 2011 the GR1 has been my daily “go to work” ruck, and I also use it for occasional travelling. Now I will be travelling a bit more, and for trips of 1+ weeks, the GR1 is just a wee bit too small. It is an expensive piece of gear, but I know first hand that their gear is of top quality, comfortable to carry, easy to pack and durable. A little bird told me that around 4 July there will be a sale, so I will be holding my horses until then.</p>\n",
